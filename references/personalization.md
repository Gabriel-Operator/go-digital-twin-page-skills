# Country, language and authenticated audience presentation (v1)

Configure `publishedConfig.personalization` in `assets/chat-config.json`, or use
Chat Publish → Audience versions. This is a presentation layer: it can replace the
persona name, description, avatar, complete landing page (including theme and
layout), signed-in `chatApp`, and embed appearance. Access, providers, credentials,
slash-command execution policies and payout approvals remain in the base config.
Never add a public country picker; use the shared automatic country lookup.
Use styled Input/Textarea/Checkbox and `app/components/Select.tsx` for controls.

## Selection and inheritance

`global` means every country and every language. Omitted/empty scope lists also
mean every country/language. Unknown country falls back to global. Language
preferences select copy; they do not imply a country or grant access.

Apply global → best matching everyone version → best authenticated audience.
Individual account IDs beat saved-profile/custom audiences. Within a tier, a
country scope beats all countries, an exact language beats a language family,
and language scopes beat all languages; higher priority then ascending ID breaks
remaining ties. `en` includes `en-GB`; `en-GB` matches only that locale.
A complete landingPage/chatApp replaces its inherited object. Embed appearance
merges shallowly. Missing identity fields inherit. Authored translations override
that version's source fields for exact language, then base language.

`icp` and `custom` audiences require a verified account and saved
`persona_user_profiles` answers. All rules match; each `oneOf` accepts strings,
numbers or booleans without coercion (4 differs from "4"). Multi-select answers
match any listed scalar. `custom.key` names the audience type; it does not execute
arbitrary code. Never trust body/query user IDs, audience labels, profile answers
or arbitrary expressions. Country is market selection, never authorization.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "enabled": true,
  "sourceLanguage": "en",
  "defaultLanguage": "en",
  "global": { "id": "global", "label": "Global country", "content": { "name": "Chakri" } },
  "variants": [
    {
      "id": "india", "label": "India", "scope": { "countryCodes": ["IN"] },
      "audience": { "type": "everyone" }, "sourceLanguage": "en", "defaultLanguage": "hi",
      "content": { "name": "Chakri India" },
      "generation": {
        "enabled": true, "regeneration": "auto", "sections": ["scrapOperations.markets"],
        "prompt": "Use the India context for the matching market. Preserve demo labels, quantities, links and human payout approval. Do not invent live rates, coverage, collectors, partners or issued certificates."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "retail-india", "label": "India retailers", "scope": { "countryCodes": ["IN"], "languages": [] },
      "audience": { "type": "custom", "key": "retail", "all": [{ "questionId": "customer-type", "oneOf": ["retail"] }] },
      "content": { "name": "Chakri for Retail" },
      "generation": { "enabled": true, "prompt": "Explain recurring shop pickups and evidence records. Keep configured actions and approval boundaries unchanged." }
    }
  ]
}
```

Profile question IDs must correspond to the persona's authored
`publishedConfig.userProfileExperience.questions`; provision that opt-in profile
when offering profile-based versions. A visitor's actual identity/answers are
never sent to the generation provider. Author prompts describe the segment.

## Git layout

```text
assets/chat-config.json                                  authoritative inline manifest
assets/personalization.json                              exact authored mirror
assets/personalization/global/source.json                 all countries/languages baseline
assets/personalization/global/prompt.json                  optional generation settings
assets/personalization/global/languages/<lang>/content.json
assets/personalization/variants/<id>/source.json
assets/personalization/variants/<id>/prompt.json
assets/personalization/variants/<id>/languages/<lang>/content.json
assets/personalization/<global|variants/id>/generated/<country|global>/<lang>/sections/<sectionId>.json
```

Keep source/language mirrors identical to the inline manifest; the editor writes
these in the same revision-checked Git commit. Runtime reads the inline manifest,
not stale source mirrors. Generated assets are separate, carry revision hashes,
and are ignored after a source/prompt/scope change. Never commit visitor profile
answers or credentials. Repository access can read authored targeting criteria,
so keep the persona repository private.

## Prompt generation and translation

The existing landing section registry derives editable copy sections. The author
can select section IDs or leave the list empty. Generation changes validated copy
only; design, localization, runtime bindings and capability configuration are
locked. Author a complete validated landingPage/chatApp to change layout or
behavior. New themes require platform support before publication. Names/avatar
are authored content, not an unconstrained generated config.

Country adaptation uses the shared model provider, region policies, durable jobs,
leases, retry/circuit breaker and daily section budget (60 per page); concurrent
requests reuse one job. Missing/unreviewed country facts never justify numerical
or operational claims. Copy remains authored while generation is pending or fails.
`manual` serves existing generated assets and never invokes a provider.

Requested languages use authored exact/base-language overrides first. Otherwise,
when landing translation is enabled, the matched copy is translated through the
existing bounded provider and three-new-languages-per-visitor/24h quota. Layout,
commands, amounts, URLs and tokens remain protected. Cache entries are keyed by
manifest/source revision, selected version, country and language; matched content
never goes into the legacy global translation cache. Signed-in app language/layout
can be authored under `translations.<lang>.chatApp`.

Presentation responses are private/no-store and contain only selected content and
sanitized selection metadata. They omit all audience definitions. Personalized
pages bypass shared immutable first-paint bundles. The browser aborts stale requests
on account, country and language changes, refreshes after saved profile changes,
and reports the actual source language while falling back. Never label fallback
English as successfully translated content.

## Validation and API

Use `references/personalization.schema.json` and
`node scripts/validate-personalization.cjs /abs/persona`.
The portable workspace validator validates the manifest/mirrors; the paired app
validator checks variant app dependencies. Paired landing SDK validators validate
whole variant pages when available. Deploy these SDKs together with platform
support; a portable structural pass is not proof that the candidate ran.

Owner endpoints: `GET /api/agent-configs/user/pages/:pageId/personalization/editor`
and `PUT .../:pageId/personalization` with `{personalization, expectedRevision}`.
The standard owner check, shared configuration lease, conflict detection, Git
publication and verification apply. A failed Git sync remains an explicit pending
draft. Visitor endpoint: `POST .../:pageId/presentation` with language, anonymousId
and optional detected-country hint; authentication provides identity. Page access
and password checks still apply. Never submit audience/profile claims.
